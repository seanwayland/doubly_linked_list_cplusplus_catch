# doubly_linked_list_cplusplus_catch


"Create a C++ program that implements a linked list. The linked list should be a doubly linked list, allowing movement forward and backward. 
This program should allow you to add and remove nodes from the list. Each node should contain a reference to application data.
The program does not have to provide user interaction. Please include units tests for the program."
